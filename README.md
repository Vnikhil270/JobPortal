This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

## Architecture and Design Decisions

### Overview
This job portal web application is built using Next.js, a powerful React framework that allows for server-side rendering and static site generation. This architecture provides a seamless user experience and improves performance through optimized loading strategies.

### Key Design Decisions
1. **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**:
   - Utilizing SSR for pages like job listings and user profiles ensures that users receive fully rendered HTML on initial load, which improves SEO and reduces time to first paint.

2. **API Routes**:
   - Next.js API routes are used to handle all backend interactions, including user authentication and job data management. This keeps the application cohesive by allowing both frontend and backend logic to reside within the same codebase.

3. **State Management**:
   - For managing state, Reactâ€™s built-in hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`) are employed. This keeps the application lightweight and easy to understand, avoiding the complexity of external state management libraries unless necessary.

4. **Responsive Design**:
   - The application uses a mobile-first design approach, ensuring that users can access the job portal from various devices. Tailwind CSS is utilized for styling, providing utility-first classes that expedite the design process.

5. **Font Optimization**:
   - The application leverages the `next/font` feature to optimize loading of custom fonts, ensuring faster render times and improved performance.

## Challenges Faced

1. **Protected Routes**:
   - Implementing protected routes posed a challenge, as it required ensuring that certain pages (like user profiles and job management) are accessible only to authenticated users. This was achieved using a combination of Next.js middleware and client-side checks to redirect unauthorized users to the login page.
   - The middleware allows for central management of authentication checks, streamlining the protection of multiple routes.

2. **State Synchronization**:
   - Keeping state synchronized between the client and server, especially for user authentication and job postings, required careful handling of API responses and local storage. Ensuring that the UI reflects the correct state at all times was crucial for a smooth user experience.

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Comprehensive error handling was implemented for both frontend and backend interactions to manage unexpected issues gracefully. This includes handling API errors and providing user feedback to improve overall usability.

4. **Deployment and Environment Configuration**:
   - Configuring the application for different environments (development, staging, production) involved managing environment variables effectively. This ensures that sensitive information (like API keys) is not exposed while maintaining functionality across different setups.
